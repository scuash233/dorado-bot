# **Adaptive Trading Bot**

## **Overview**

The Adaptive Trading Bot is a Python-based automated trading solution designed to execute trades on financial markets based on customizable strategies. The bot retrieves real-time market data, performs technical analysis, and adapts its trading strategy dynamically based on market conditions. Users can define custom strategies, backtest them on historical data, and run the bot in live trading environments.

## **Key Features**

- **Customizable Trading Strategy**:  
  Define and tweak your own trading strategies using popular technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI, MACD).
  
- **Real-Time Market Data and Execution**:  
  The bot connects to trading APIs (e.g., Binance, Alpaca, IEX Cloud) to gather real-time market data and execute trades automatically.
  
- **Adaptive Algorithm**:  
  Continuously adjusts trading parameters based on market volatility, trends, and other conditions to optimize strategy performance.
  
- **Backtesting Module**:  
  Simulate and backtest strategies using historical market data to fine-tune your approach before going live.
  
- **Risk Management**:  
  Built-in risk control mechanisms like position sizing, stop-loss, take-profit levels, and drawdown limits to protect your capital.
  
- **User Dashboard**:  
  A simple interface to monitor live performance, tweak strategies, and view historical trade data in real-time.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Market Data APIs**: Binance, Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud, Alpaca (configurable)
- **Libraries**:
  - **Data Analysis**: `Pandas`, `NumPy`
  - **Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `plotly`
